# Computational Finance Project

This is a finance project that I worked on to gain hands-on experience in financial analysis and portfolio management.

## Overview

The project is based on the following topics:

- Forecasting Stock Data


The project includes the following components:

- Data gathering and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Stock selection using fundamental and technical analysis
- Portfolio construction using different strategies


## Methodology

The project uses Python and various libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

The project includes the following steps:

1. Data gathering and preprocessing: The project collects historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and preprocesses the data to make it suitable for analysis.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The project uses EDA techniques to understand the data, identify patterns, and visualize the trends.
3. Stock selection: The project uses fundamental and technical analysis to select stocks based on their financial health and market performance.
4. Portfolio construction: The project constructs portfolios using different strategies such as equal weighting, minimum variance, and risk parity.
5. Risk analysis: The project evaluates the risk of the portfolios using various metrics such as standard deviation, beta, and Value-at-Risk (VaR).
6. Performance evaluation: The project evaluates the performance of the portfolios using different benchmarks such as the S&P 500 index and risk-free rate.

## LSTM for Stock Forecasting

As a part of this project, I have also used LSTM for stock forecasting. I have collected historical stock price data of a particular stock and trained an LSTM model to predict its future prices.

## Conclusion

Overall, this finance project has given me valuable experience in financial analysis, portfolio management, and machine learning techniques such as LSTM for stock forecasting.
